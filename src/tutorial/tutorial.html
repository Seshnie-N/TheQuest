      <h2>How to Play:</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of the game is to explore the maize, fight monsters and get out!
      </p>
      <p>
        During the game, you will come across gates. These gates prevent you
        from getting out.
      </p>
      <p>
        To unlock the gates, you must get keys. But beware, for this is no easy
        task! Monsters hold these keys and must be slayin to obtain them.
      </p>
      <p>Goodluck on your Quest and do not DIE!</p>

      <h2>Controls:</h2>
      <p>Use the "WASD" keys to move</p>
      <p>Use "Space-bar" to jump</p>
      <p>Use "Shift" to run</p>
      <p>click the monster to hit it</p>
      <p>
        In order to complete a level, place the key in the gate to open up the
